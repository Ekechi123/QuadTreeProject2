QuadTree Project

This project implements a QuadTree data structure, commonly used for efficient spatial partitioning. The QuadTree organizes rectangular objects in a hierarchical structure to facilitate fast spatial queries, such as collision detection or spatial indexing.
Project Structure

Main.java: Contains the entry point of the application, where the QuadTree is initialized and tested.
QuadTree.java: Contains the implementation of the QuadTree data structure.
Rectangle2D: Represents rectangular objects inserted into the QuadTree.
Requirements

Java 8 or higher must be installed on your machine.
Basic understanding of spatial partitioning and QuadTrees.
Setup Instructions

Step 1: Clone or Download the Project
Clone the project from GitHub or download the files to your local machine.

Step 2: Open the Terminal or Command Prompt
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the project is located. You can do this using the cd (change directory) command. For example:
cd /path/to/QuadTreeProject

Step 3: Compile the Code
Ensure that you have Java installed. Compile the .java files using the javac command:
javac Main.java QuadTree.java
This will compile the Java source files into bytecode (.class files) that can be executed.

Step 4: Run the Program
After compiling, you can run the program with the java command:
java Main

This will run the Main.java file, which will initialize a QuadTree, insert a Rectangle2D object, and display the objects in the tree.

Objects in this QuadTree:
Rectangle: java.awt.geom.Rectangle2D$Double[x=10.5,y=20.5,w=30.5,h=40.5]
